# Given an array of strings, print only the strings that have exactly 4 characters. 

# goal - print only strings with 4 characters
#pseudo
# names = [names]
# names.each do |name|
# print name if the name length is equal to 4
# end
names = ["Shawn", "Mo", "Astrid", "Dave", "Josh"]
names.each do |name|
puts name if name.length == 4
end

# This challenge was also pretty straightforward. These were methods we had worked with previously.
