# Write a method or function that removes all instances of the letter <strong>s</strong> in a string.The method or function should accept a string as an argument and return the same string with every instance of the letter <strong>s</strong> removed.

# goal - method that removes "S, s" from string
# pseudo -
# define method for string
# string.method that removes a certain character
#end
def remove_s(string)
string.delete ("S" "s")
end

puts remove_s("Sister Suzy Sitting on a Thistle")

# This was a bit more challenging, but I managed to find a method that worked to delete a character within a string fairly quickly with a Google search.
